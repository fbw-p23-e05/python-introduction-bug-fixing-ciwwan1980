# Your task is to fix program non-working correctly.
# The problem:  
# - accept (prompt) two integers values from the user  
# - check whether a first number is divisible by second number and vice versa  
# - display results  

x = int(input("First number: "))
y = int(input("Second number: "))

if x % y == 0:
    print("First number is divisible by second number, result =", x // y)
elif y % x == 0:
    print("Second number is divisible by first number, result =", y // x)
else:
    print("Numbers are non-divisible!")
